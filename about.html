<!--For the theme of the app I am using mostly black and #DB53FB colour since I consider them as an appealing
compination. Additionally, #DB53FB is a client requirement, but it is also makes the app more 
engaging, warm, and welcoming-->

Web Designers' choice of colours
<br>
<br>
I have chosen the colour black along with the colour <b class="purplecolour">purple</b> (#DB53FB) 
because I consider them as a welcoming combination in order 
to send a musical vibe, since this is the purpose of this web app.
Furthermore, I do not prefer bright white color since it can be disturbing for some
people to use it during the night. Consequently, since this is a music web app that can be used either at night or day, I have chosen the main color of the web app to be black because it's more relaxing to the eye.
<br>
<br>
In addition to that, I had to meet my client requirements as well. I achieved that by
choosing the main color of the logo to be my client's choice. Moreover, I tone the words that I consider them more important than the rest with the same color.
 As a result, with the combination of a dark colour such as black in the backrounnd, 
 the <b class="purplecolour">purple</b> (#DB53FB) colour definitely stands out.
